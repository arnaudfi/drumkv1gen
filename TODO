TODO items:

- output an .svg file that shows the keymap for the created file
  -> alternatively: an "active" HTML page where hovering over a key
     displays the file loaded onto it

- set amp and filter env to "as long as possible" to avoid cutting of samples
- allow user to specify initial key number in "folder-scan" mode (currently hardcoded to 36)

- detect re-use of already mapped keys in map file and report them as a warning
- add "plausibility check" (do referenced files exist at all?) and report them as such

- write man page
- add long options to help text
- print out how many samples were mapped

- when writing out the .drumkv1, als write out the .map file to allow further modifications by user
- when writing out the files and they exist alrady, interactively ask user if ok to overwrite
- -f option (force) still overwrites everything without asking
- allow user to set MIDI # of first note in "directory scan" mode (default 36)

Check:
- is the path stored correctly when the .drumkv1 target is outside the sample dir?

- next to each sample, also print out (in a comment line) the "natural name" of the
  drum instrument that's assigned to it in the general MIDI mapping?
